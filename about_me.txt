Hello! My name is Elijah Kaufman and I'm a freshman at the University of Michigan.
I currently hope to double major in Data Science and Political Science to pursue a career as a political data analyst or quantitative policy analyst.
A fun fact about me is that I love reading horror and fantasy books, with my personal favorite being Pet Sematary by Stephen King.
